/**
 * The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields. You
 * can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the
 * superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended). You can declare new fields in
 * the subclass that are not in the superclass. The inherited methods can be
 * used directly as they are. You can write a new instance method in the
 * subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus
 * overriding it. You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the
 * same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it. You can declare
 * new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass. You can write a
 * subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either
 * implicitly or by using the keyword super. The following sections in this
 * lesson will expand on these topics.
